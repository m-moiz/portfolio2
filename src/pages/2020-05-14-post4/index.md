/Research
1. The level that ai composititon is at right now
2. The ai techniques used to accomplish the cutting edge of this niche
3. The future of compostitional ai
4. Why do we watch competition

Args for
1. There aren't an infinite stream of musical ideas, a sophisticated AI empties that well quicker.
2. At the ideal level ai can replicate top composers ability perfectly. So there will be an Ai mozart, an ai beethoven or an ai skrillex for all we care.
3. One aspect of art is that art invokes human emotions. The creators of art deliberately and meticulosly choose to invoke certian emotions in their art. 
4. Another aspect is the artists craftsmanship, as consumers we appreciate the time it takes to accomplish a piece. 



Args against
1. Musicians have been copying other musicians for decades
2. AI can help in the compositional aspect
3. AI brings diversity to music
4. AI robots can be a new genre
5. Gamers like to see real players compete instead of ai. /Why we watch competition and fights?
6. Research in these types of areas can bring insights and techniques that can be applied to more salient problems.
